# ADR-0063 — amendment notes

### Amendment 2026-10-21 — Remove of an added identity deletes its key with it (ii)

rust-ui-dev proposed the acceptance criteria for the card and the key
(plan §29 steps 1–2) the same evening the record landed and asked two
things it did not say: what Remove does to the key, and whether the
recovery flow tells the person about the key change. Ruled: Remove of
an added identity (ADR-0061 decision 7) deletes its key file and its
Keystore alias with the endpoint, the conversations, the contacts and
the card — the key is the identity's — while a counterparty keeps the
contact it accepted, so a later identity on the freed label is a key
change to them; and the phrase-recovery flow on fresh state says,
before it takes the phrase, that every identity gets a new key and
counterparties will see a key change for each (decision 1's
consequence, now on a screen). The seventeen criteria, two of them
device rows, are in `human-client-ui.md` §13 with their record lines.
